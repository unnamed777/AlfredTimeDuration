# Duration Calculator - Alfred Workflow

[Original workflow](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/4568-duration-calculator-%E2%80%94-add-and-subtract-durations-of-time/)

This is a fixed app for workflow. To apply the fixes you need to replace original binary "duration" with [this one](/unnamed777/exbankrot_lead_distributor/releases) in installed workflow folder (Alfred > Workflows > Duration Calculator > right click > Show in Finder).
